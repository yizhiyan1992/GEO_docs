2. Walkthrough of OSM:
  - The walkthrough teaches how to edit the points, lines, and areas.
  - we use the word "features" to describe the things that appear on the map. Map features aree represented by points, lines, and areas.
  - when a feature is selected, the feature editor is displayed alongside the map. (for street, it can show oneway, number of lanes and other attributes.)
  - Points: used to represent features such as shops, restaurants and monuments. (we can add a point in the map and edit its information)
  - Areas: used to show the boundaries of features like buildings and residential areas.
  - Lines: used to represent features such as roads, railroads, and rivers. (we can create, edit the roads and its connecting nodes)
